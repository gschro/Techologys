Safe reading 
On the same basis, as above, if a particular cookie does not exists, a corresponding object (CHttpCookie instance) for it will not be created! Trying to read such cookie will result in error "Trying to get property of non-object". To avoid that, it is always better to read a cookie using ternary operator, like that:

$value = isset(Yii::app()->request->cookies['cookie_name']) ? Yii::app()->request->cookies['cookie_name']->value : '';
// or
$value = Yii::app()->request->cookies->contains('cookie_name') ?
Yii::app()->request->cookies['cookie_name']->value : '';
This way, you'll get either cookie value or an empty string.

This example also gives us idea how to check, if particular cookie exits:

$is_cookie = !isset(Yii::app()->request->cookies['cookie_name']);
